# Treasure-Island-Game
Just a fun game to play in the terminal. All you need is (python3)[https://www.python.org/downloads/] installed, git to clone the repo (using `git clone`), and your favorite terminal. Enjoy and feel free to save the code and make your own story or even make a clean GUI.

```
`git clone https://github.com/christien07/Treasure-Island-Game.git`
`cd /path/to/Treasure-Island-Game`
`python .\main.py` or `python ./main.py`
```

Let me know if you have any issues and feel free to submit a pull request. I'm open to any and all suggestions.
